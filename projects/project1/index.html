for fear of developing back pains, sisyphus requested a new trial.
zeus gave him a pair of scissors and told him to start trimming his beard.
"hah! ez" sisyphus said, to which zeus responded by cursing his beard.
now the beard won't stop growing, and sisyphus can't stop cutting.
give the poor guy a hand! try to shave off his beard, or at least push back his impending tendinitis
