<!-- in fear of developing back pains, sisyphus requested a new trial.
zeus gave him a pair of scissors and told him to start trimming his beard.

"hah! ez" sisyphus said, to which zeus responded by cursing the said beard,
causing it to grow at a most unnatural rate.

<div id="text3" class="introText">
that sucks, especially since sisy's gf won't even talk to him unless he has
a clean shave (she spent some years in the military).
</div>

<div id="text4" class="introText">
now the beard won't stop growing, and your friend sisyphus won't stop cutting.
you fear the worst for him: after all, zeus has quite the reputation when it
comes to ladies.
</div>

<div id="text5" class="introText">

push back his impending tendinitis.
